# Meal Planning
When asked to help meal plan, follow these steps:
1. Ask me if I want to generate any new recipies
  - If yes, ask me a few questions about what kind of recipe then use existing recipies as an example to generate the new one(s)
2. Ask me how many meals to plan and whether to include any new recipies
3. Generate a shopping list and pause so I can remove items I already have on hand.
4. Send the remaining items and meals to todoist following the instructions in @README.md 

# Generating new recipies
Wen asked to generate new recipies:

- Assume we're generating dinner recipies unless otherwise specified.
- Aim for variety across the week (different proteins, cuisines, cooking methods)
- Balance quick meals with more involved ones based on schedule
- Consider prep work that can be done ahead (pre-cooked proteins, chopped veggies)
- Account for dietary restrictions when planning (especially Mom's red meat preference)
- Use ratings to balance family favorites with new experiments
- Group recipes with overlapping ingredients to minimize shopping
