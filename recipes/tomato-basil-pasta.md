Simple, fresh pasta dish that comes together quickly. Great for using up fresh tomatoes and basil when in season.

# Directions

- Cook pasta according to package directions
- While pasta cooks, heat oil in a large pan over medium heat
- Add onion, cook until softened
- Add garlic and red pepper flakes, cook for 30 seconds
- Add tomatoes, salt, and pepper

- Add pasta to sauce, toss to combine
- Add fresh basil and toss

# Other Considerations

Can add pre-cooked chicken or other protein. For a heartier version, add mushrooms or bell peppers. Fresh tomatoes work best, but can use canned diced tomatoes in a pinch.
