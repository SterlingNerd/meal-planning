A simple one-pot-style dinner that leans on ingredients you're already using this week: pasta, chicken, broccoli, and Italian seasonings, brightened with lemon. Great for a quick night or for using leftover cooked chicken.

# Directions

- Start pasta in salted water according to package directions.
- In a large pan, heat oil over medium. Season chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning; cook until done. Set aside.
- In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed and sauté onion until soft. Add broccoli and a splash of water; cover and steam until broccoli is tender-crisp.
- Slice or shred the chicken and add back to the pan. Drain pasta (reserve a little pasta water) and add to the pan. Toss with lemon juice and zest, more garlic powder and Italian seasoning if you like, and pasta water to loosen. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

# Other Considerations

If you have nutritional yeast on hand, a sprinkle at the end adds a nice touch.
