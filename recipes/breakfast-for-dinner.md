# Directions

## Potatoes
- Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat
- Add diced potatoes, season with salt and pepper
- Cook until golden and crispy, stirring occasionally
- Add peppers and onion partway through
- Remove when done

## Bacon
- Cook bacon in separate pan or oven until crispy
- Remove and drain

## Eggs
- Scramble eggs in the same pan (or clean pan)
- Season with salt and pepper
- Cook to desired doneness

## Serve
- Plate eggs, potatoes, and bacon together
- Can add toast or fruit on the side

# Other Considerations

Can make hash browns in the oven on a sheet pan for easier cleanup. For a lighter option, can use egg whites or fewer eggs. Very flexible - can add mushrooms, spinach, or other vegetables to the potatoes.
