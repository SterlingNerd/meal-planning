A dairy free riff on chicken alfredo. It's not trying to mimic the exact taste alfredo sauce, but more the creamy comforting feel.

# Direction

## Pasta
- Cook pasta according to directions on package

## Meat
- If not using pre-cooked meat, use some oil and cook it in the saucepan until almost done
- Set aside

## Sauce
- Heat Oil in large saucepan over low/medium heat
- Add flour to create a roux
- Slowly add milk while whisking until sauce is slightly thinner than desired (it will thicken as it cooks and we add the pasta)
- Add garlic, yeast, spices
- Add meat

## Finish
- Once pasta is nearly done, transfer to saucepan. 
- Use pasta water to adjust sauce consistency
