# Directions

## Sous Vide Chicken
- Set sous vide to 150°F for breasts, 165°F for thighs
- Season chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder
- Vacuum seal or use ziplock with water displacement method
- Cook for 1-2 hours (can go longer, very forgiving)

## Roasted Vegetables
- Preheat oven to 425°F
- Toss vegetables with oil, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning
- Spread on sheet pan(s) in single layer
- Roast for 20-25 minutes until tender and slightly charred

## Finish
- Remove chicken from sous vide bag
- Pat dry and sear in hot pan for 1-2 minutes per side for color

# Other Considerations

The sous vide timing is very flexible - can start it early and let it hold. Vegetables can be varied based on what's available. Kid usually prefers thighs over breasts.
