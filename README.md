# Goals
We want to develop a varied meal plan for our family to avoid the dreaded "what's for dinner. We also want to leverage our library of recipes to generate weekly shopping lists.

# The Famly
We are a family of three: mom, dad, and 10yr old girl. Recipes should be kid-friendly, but we also want to expose her to a wide variety.

# Food Restrictions
- **Dairy Free**: Meals must not use dairy ingredients. Substitutes are acceptible.
- **No Avocados**: Avocados must be avoided.
- **Modest refined Carbs**: While not a strict ban, refined carbs and added sugar should be kept low
- **Avoid Sea Food**: Our child will not eat seafood. We'll need alternatives for her if we are making a seafood dish.
- **Minimize Red Meat for Mom**: Red meat is fine occasionally, but not every day. Typically we cook an alternative protien for Mom.

# Style
- We don't need exact recipes. We usually cook by theme and feel. See `recipies/fake-fredo.md` for an example.
