# Meal Planning Recipe Library

This repository contains a collection of family-friendly recipes designed to help plan meals and generate shopping lists. Our recipes follow a flexible, theme-based approach rather than strict measurements, making it easy to adapt to what's available and personal preferences.

# Goals

We want to develop a varied meal plan for our family to avoid the dreaded "what's for dinner?" We also want to leverage our library of recipes to generate weekly shopping lists.

# The Family

We are a family of three: mom, dad, and 10yr old girl. Recipes should be kid-friendly, but we also want to expose her to a wide variety.

# Food Restrictions

- **Dairy Free**: Meals must not use dairy ingredients. Substitutes are acceptable.
- **No Avocados**: Avocados must be avoided.
- **Modest refined Carbs**: While not a strict ban, refined carbs and added sugar should be kept low
- **Avoid Sea Food**: Our child will not eat seafood. We'll need alternatives for her if we are making a seafood dish.
- **Minimize Red Meat for Mom**: Red meat is fine occasionally, but not every day. Typically we cook an alternative protein for Mom.

# Recipe Format

All recipes are stored in the `recipes/` directory and follow a consistent format:

- **Title**: Recipe name
- **Rating Table**: Four metrics on a 1-5 scale:
  - Rating: Overall family enjoyment/appeal
  - Ease: Difficulty/complexity of preparation
  - Quickness: Time to prepare and cook
  - Affordability: Cost of ingredients
- **Description** (optional): Brief notes about the dish
- **Ingredients Table**: List of ingredients with amounts and notes
- **Directions**: Step-by-step cooking instructions
- **Other Considerations** (optional): Additional notes, substitutions, or variations

See `recipes/fake-fredo.md` for an example of our flexible, theme-based approach.

# Rating System

Each recipe includes ratings on a 1-5 scale:

- **Rating (1-5)**: Overall family enjoyment and appeal
  - 5 = Family favorite, everyone loves it
  - 4 = Very good, well-liked
  - 3 = Good, acceptable
  - 2 = Okay, needs improvement
  - 1 = Not a favorite

- **Ease (1-5)**: Difficulty and complexity of preparation
  - 5 = Very easy, minimal prep
  - 4 = Easy, straightforward
  - 3 = Moderate, some technique required
  - 2 = Challenging, requires skill
  - 1 = Very difficult, complex techniques

- **Quickness (1-5)**: Time to prepare and cook
  - 5 = Very quick, under 15 minutes
  - 4 = Quick, 15-30 minutes
  - 3 = Moderate, 30-60 minutes
  - 2 = Slow, 1-2 hours
  - 1 = Very slow, 2+ hours

- **Affordability (1-5)**: Cost of ingredients
  - 5 = Very affordable, budget-friendly
  - 4 = Affordable, reasonable cost
  - 3 = Moderate, average cost
  - 2 = Expensive, higher cost
  - 1 = Very expensive, premium ingredients

# Style

We don't need exact recipes. We usually cook by theme and feel, adapting ingredients and quantities based on what's available and our preferences. Recipes serve as guides and inspiration rather than strict instructions.

# Meal Planning Notes

When generating meal plans from this recipe library:

- Aim for variety across the week (different proteins, cuisines, cooking methods)
- Balance quick meals with more involved ones based on schedule
- Consider prep work that can be done ahead (pre-cooked proteins, chopped veggies)
- Account for dietary restrictions when planning (especially Mom's red meat preference)
- Use ratings to balance family favorites with new experiments
- Group recipes with overlapping ingredients to minimize shopping
